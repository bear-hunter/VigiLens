    Analyzes a given video file for shoplifting behavior.
    
    This is a placeholder function that simulates a long-running AI task.
    It waits for a few seconds and then creates a dummy incident in the database.
    
    In a real system:
    1. This function would be run in a separate background process (e.g., Celery).
    2. It would use OpenCV to read the video frame by frame.
    3. Each frame would be passed to a pose estimation model (YOLOv11).
    4. The sequence of poses would be fed to an anomaly detection model (Transformer).
    5. If an anomaly is detected, it would save the video clip and thumbnail.
    6. Finally, it would add the incident to the database.

    :param video_path: The absolute path to the uploaded video file.
    :param app_context: The Flask application context, needed to interact with the database.
